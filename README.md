### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1643515023/10521/meow_code.gif?1643515023" width="25"/>

I'm Kresha, a budding coder getting back into the tech scene. Currently on a quest to rediscover programming, I'm diving into new tech and projects with a fresh perspective. I'm all about continuous learning and sharing whatever I pick up along the way.
